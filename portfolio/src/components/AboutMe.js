                    <h2 class="introduction">I am from Ankeny, IA, just outside of Des Moines. I went to school at Iowa Western Community College and transferred to the University of Northern Iowa to finish my undergraduate in psychology. Through all four years of college I had the opportunity to play for both of my schools' golf teams. I graduated from UNI in the winter of 2019 and began a career in the golf industry. The game of golf will always be special to me, but I loved it more as a sport and less as a job. I have always been around technology and have had a decent aptitude for it. I always found what developers do to be very interesting and wondered if I could do it myself. I took a step towards answering that question by enrolling in Northwestern University's coding bootcamp and have been amazed at the skills I have learned. I am eager to see where this journey goes in the future! </h2>
